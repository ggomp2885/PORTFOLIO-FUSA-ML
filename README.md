# PORTFOLIO-FUSA-ML
Portfolio to showcase my work in End-to-End Machine learning with Financial data. As the Lead Machine Learning Engineer of Funders USA I built and deployed a classification ML model for predicting the % chance that a startup would successfully raise their funding round in the next 12 months. 

To start exploring:
1. open up the folder titled, "machine learning" - This folder contains 4 more folders, one for each step of the model building process. (Data collection, Data Preprocessing, Model Testing, and Deployment)
2. Each of these 4 folders, has a one or two ".ipynb" jupyternotebook files within them, which hold the execution code to run on the datasets, contained in the datasets folder
3. The bulk of this is written to run in the AWS Sagemaker Data Science Environment and deployed to a live AWS Endpoint for real time use



Note: some original folders have been removed to protect the privacy of the company, and I display the ones that showcase my machine learning work
