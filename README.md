# PORTFOLIO-FUSA-ML
Portfolio to showcase my work in End-to-End Machine learning with Financial data. As the Lead Machine Learning Engineer of Funders USA I built and deployed a classification ML model for predicting the % chance that a startup would successfully raise their funding round in the next 12 months. 

Note: My work included building the entire pipeline from data collection to model deployment, some original folders have been removed to protect the privacy of the company, and I display the ones that showcase my machine learning work
